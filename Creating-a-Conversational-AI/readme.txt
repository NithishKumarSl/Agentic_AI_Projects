# Conversational AI for Competitor Analysis in Retail

## Problem Statement
Businesses in competitive locations, especially clothing stores in busy areas, need to monitor their market rivals to stay relevant and maximize customer engagement. This project addresses this challenge by providing a conversational AI pipeline that allows users to query and generate reports on nearby clothing store competitors. The system integrates a language model with a search tool to provide real-time data on competitors, including store footfall and busiest times, giving actionable insights to enhance business strategies.

## Intended Beneficiaries
- **Business Owners and Managers:** Identify key competitors, analyze peak customer hours, and adjust strategies to improve market position.
- **Marketing and Strategy Teams:** Optimize promotions during high-traffic periods and shape targeted campaigns based on competitor data.
- **Real Estate and Location Analysts:** Recommend ideal store locations and identify high-value times for new store launches.
- **Investors and Market Analysts:** Assess market saturation, business potential, and risks in high-traffic retail areas.

## What This Notebook Does
- Provides a conversational interface to query competitor data for clothing stores in a given area.
- Uses a language model and search tools to fetch real-time information on:
  - Types of competitors (Brand vs Local)
  - Market segment distribution (Budget, Mid-tier, Luxury)
  - Store size distribution
  - Footfall trends and busiest hours
- Generates visual reports (charts and heatmaps) for easy analysis.

## Features
- **Conversational AI:** Ask questions about local competitors and get actionable insights.
- **Data Visualization:** Automatic generation of pie charts, bar charts, and heatmaps for competitor analysis.
- **Real-Time Data:** Integrates with search tools for up-to-date information.
- **Customizable Reports:** Tailor queries to specific locations or competitor types.

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Colab.
2. Run all cells to initialize the conversational AI pipeline.
3. Interact with the system by entering queries about clothing store competitors in your area.
4. View generated reports and visualizations.
